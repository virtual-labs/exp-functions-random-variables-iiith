# Procedure for the experiments for Functions of Random Variables experiment

## Finding the CDF of a CRV  Y based on a function of X
- You are given a graph which plots some function $Y = g(X)$ of a random variable $X$
- You have to build the appropriate CDF of the point \(y_i\) which is generated randomly from the points $x_i$ as shown in the graph 
- You can add the CDF values of $ x_i $ from the given list by clicking on it in the top panel.
- You can remove the CDF values of $x_i$ from the given list by  clicking on it in the bottom panel.
- Once you have built the answer, click on the submit button to check your answer.
